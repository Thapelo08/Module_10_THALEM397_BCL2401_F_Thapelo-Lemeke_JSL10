# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

## INTRODUCTION

-The Escape Vanilla JS Challenge is an interactive web-based project focusing on debugging skills, problem-solving, and the concept of abstraction. 
- I navigate through three themed "rooms," each presenting a unique challenge that requires them to debug and correct given JavaScript code to proceed. 
-This adventure is themed around escaping the confines of Vanilla JavaScript to advance towards learning React.

## CHALLENGES
